ISOTP

This project implements a transport-agnostic implementation of ISOTP,
based on the spec (ref ISO-15765-2:2016).

To use this project:

1. Invoke isotp_ctx_init() passing in the following:
   - a pointer to an ISOTP context which will be allocated
   - what CAN frame format to use (CAN, CAN-FD)
   - ISOTP addressing mode
   - pointer to a CAN transmit and CAN receive function
   - pointer to an opaque CAN context to be passed to the CAN transmit
     and receive functions

2. To send ISOTP data, invoke isotp_send()
3. To receive ISOTP data, invoke isotp_recv()

Before sending or receiving invoke isotp_ctx_reset() on the ISOTP context.

For an example refer to unit_tests/main_test.c
